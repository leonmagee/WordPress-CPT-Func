How do infections happen?

1- Outdated Software
2- Exploited FTP Password
3- Hosting Issue
4- Expoit (Zero Day)

What can we do?
- Keep Software Updated
- No Soup Kitchen Servers
- Reduce Access
- Password Management
- Backup Schedule

Keep Software Updated
- Leading cause along with passwords
- Scared to upgrade?
- Major for Point Release
- Run upgrade tests
- Do your homework 

No Soup Kitchen Servers
- WordPresser forget about dev? 
- Cross-contamination
- Segment by user and account
- Not active? Not good enough

Reduce Acces
- User Proper Roles
- This goes for WP, FTP, & DB's, etc...
- Limit failed logins to thwart brute force
- Practice two form auth & layered login 
- Removing admin user is not important

So...
- Make a new long password to use
- PasswordReallyRad ! @ # $ % ^ & * () () () ---- =====  

Password Management
- Password still top 5
- Use unique
- Different passwords
- Pass management tools 
- Username is easy to find 

Backup Schedule
- VaultPress 
- Two form authentication 
- Google Authenticator
- Limit Login Attempts
